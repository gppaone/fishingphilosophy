        <p>Here are some of the top paints used for painting lures. (See great <a href="#additional" class="text-blue-700 underline">Additional Paint Sets</a> options below.)</p>
        <p class="mt-4 py-8 px-4 rounded bg-amber-100">There are many paint and ink brands that offer a wide range of colors to choose from. While you could get by with some acrylic hobby paints from your local store, in my experience they’re often too thick and the color intensity can be lacking. Most paints will need to be thinned to work properly with the fine tips of an airbrush.  <br><br>Please see the <a href="/supplies/accessories" class="text-blue-700 underline">Accessories</a> page for additional necessary items.</p>
