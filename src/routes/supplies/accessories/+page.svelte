                <p>The Vallejo Airbrush Flow Improver is a specialized medium designed to enhance the application of acrylic paints through airbrushing. By reducing the paint's surface tension, it promotes smoother flow and helps prevent issues like tip-drying, ensuring a more consistent and professional finish. Additionally, it slightly extends the drying time, allowing for better blending and leveling of the paint. To achieve optimal results, it's recommended to add 1–2 drops of Flow Improver for every 10 drops of paint in the airbrush cup.</p>
